# Bitcoin Trust Prediction
In this project I will predict the trust scores between two bitcoin traders who have never interacted with each other.
The data I am using comes from the Bitcoin Alpha trust weighted signed network dataset.

The main goal of the project is to extract meaningful features from the network using data mining theories.
